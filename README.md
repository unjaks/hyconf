On first launch will ask you for your preferred editor's command (nvim, vi, nano, etc.)
Will list all files and directories in `$HOME/.config/hypr` and, after choosing a configuration file, will open that file with previously chosen editor.
That's all.
Oh, right. No AI was used in the making of this except for general info on AUR package publishing because this is my first time publishing a package to the arch user repository lol.
